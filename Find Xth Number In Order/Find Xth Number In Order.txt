Write a function, getX, that given an int x and a integer array num, returns the Xth number if the list was in sorted order. In other words, the Xth smallest number.

Function Name: getX
Input: An integer, x, and an unsorted list of integers nums that aren’t necessarily distinct
Output: The integer corresponding to the Xth number in the sorted list

Example:

getX(2, [5, 10, -3, -3, 7, 9]) => -3

The second number in order is -3.

getX(4, [5, 10, -3 , -3, 7, 9]) => 7

The fourth number in order is 7.

Note that this assumes the first number is position 1, not 0.
